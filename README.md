BIG Ben Tower is an monumental Gothic Structure . I used Opengl 3.3 and C++ here to replicate my version of  BIG Ben Tower and Westminister Bridge . Several Complex Shapes Like Minar as lamppost (created as Bezier Curve),  Bridge Shape As Half - TORUS . This was done a project delegated to us in CSE  4208 or computer Graphics !!
